1. **Allergic Asthma**: Triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.
2. **Non-allergic Asthma**: Triggered by stress, exercise, illnesses, weather, or irritants.
3. **Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)**: Triggered by physical activity.
4. **Occupational Asthma**: Caused by workplace irritants.
5. **Childhood Asthma**: Affects children, may improve or worsen with age.
6. **Adult-onset Asthma**: Begins during adulthood.

## How is Asthma Diagnosed?

### Diagnostic Tests Include:

- **Physical Exam**: Assessing signs of asthma and ruling out other conditions.
- **Spirometry**: Measures airflow and lung function.
- **Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)**: Measures how fast you can exhale.
- **Methacholine Challenge Test**: Identifies airway hyperresponsiveness.
- **Imaging Tests**: Chest X-rays or CT scans.
- **Allergy Testing**: Identifies potential allergens.

## What is Asthma Control?

Asthma control refers to how well your symptoms are managed. Well-controlled asthma allows normal daily activities and restful sleep, while poorly controlled asthma can lead to flare-ups and hospital visits.

### Medications:

- **Long-term control**:
  - Inhaled corticosteroids
  - Leukotriene modifiers
  - Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs)
  - Combination inhalers
  - Biologic therapies

- **Quick-relief**:
  - Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs)
  - Anticholinergics
  - Oral corticosteroids (for severe flare-ups)

## How Can I Prevent Asthma Flare-Ups?

- Identify and avoid triggers
- Take medication as prescribed
- Use a written asthma action plan
- Monitor symptoms and peak flow

---

## What’s the Outlook for People With Asthma?

Most people with asthma live normal, active lives. While there is no cure, proper treatment and management can control symptoms and prevent complications.
