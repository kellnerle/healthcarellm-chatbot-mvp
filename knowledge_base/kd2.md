# Asthma Attack: Diagnosis and Treatment â€” Mayo Clinic

---

## Overview

An asthma attack occurs when your airways become inflamed and narrow, making it hard to breathe. Minor asthma attacks may improve with home treatment, but severe attacks can be life-threatening and require emergency medical attention.

---

## Symptoms

- Severe shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Coughing or wheezing
- Low peak expiratory flow (PEF)
- Trouble speaking
- Pale, sweaty face

---

## Diagnosis

Doctors may diagnose an asthma attack based on:

- **Medical history**: Chronic asthma, allergies, exposure to triggers.
- **Physical exam**: Listening for wheezing or reduced breath sounds.
- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Includes spirometry and peak flow.
- **Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gases**: To assess oxygen levels.

---

## Treatment

### Immediate care

- **Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs)** like albuterol.
- **Ipratropium (Atrovent)** for severe cases.
- **Oral corticosteroids** (e.g., prednisone).
- **Oxygen therapy** if oxygen saturation is low.

### Severe cases

- **Hospitalization** may be required.
- **Intubation or mechanical ventilation** in extreme cases.
- Continuous **bronchodilator nebulization**.

---

## Prevention

- **Daily controller medications** (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids).
- **Avoiding triggers** (e.g., allergens, smoke, cold air).
- **Regular checkups** with a healthcare provider.
- **Using a peak flow meter** to monitor lung function.

## When to Seek Emergency Care

- Rapid worsening of symptoms
- No improvement after using a rescue inhaler
- Difficulty speaking due to shortness of breath
- Cyanosis (blue lips or face)
