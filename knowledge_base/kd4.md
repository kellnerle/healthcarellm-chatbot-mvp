# Asthma: Diagnosis and Treatment â€” Mayo Clinic

---

## Diagnosis

Asthma is diagnosed based on:

- **Medical history and physical exam**
- **Lung function tests**:
  - **Spirometry**: Measures how much air you inhale and exhale, and how quickly.
  - **Peak flow**: Measures how hard you can breathe out.
- **Methacholine challenge**: Checks airway sensitivity.
- **Allergy testing**
- **Imaging tests** (e.g., X-rays to rule out other conditions)

## Treatment

### Long-Term Control Medications

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: First-line treatment for most.
- **Leukotriene modifiers**: Oral meds to reduce inflammation.
- **Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs)**: Often combined with corticosteroids.
- **Theophylline**: Mild bronchodilator, less commonly used.

### Quick-Relief Medications

- **Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs)** like albuterol.
- **Anticholinergics**: Used if SABAs are not tolerated.
- **Oral corticosteroids**: For severe flare-ups.
