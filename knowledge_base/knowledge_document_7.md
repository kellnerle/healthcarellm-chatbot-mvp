## Asthma Medications and Treatment

When it comes to understanding all of the asthma treatments available, it’s natural to feel a little bit confused.

The important thing to remember is that asthma is a “variable” disease. In other words, asthma symptoms, severity and treatment plans can vary from person to person, and even the same person’s condition may fluctuate throughout the year.  


The two most common types of asthma medications are [controllers](https://asthma.ca/get-help/treatment/controllers/) which treat the long-term, underlying inflammation in your airways and [relievers ](https://asthma.ca/get-help/treatment/relievers/)which act as your rescue inhaler and provide fast but short-term relief of symptoms. You should speak with your [healthcare professional](https://asthma.ca/get-help/diagnosis/your-healthcare-team/) about finding a treatment plan that is right for you.  


## If you have asthma, your healthcare team will:

  * Explain how you can keep your asthma under control by avoiding your personal [triggers](https://asthma.ca/get-help/asthma-triggers/)
  * Prescribe medication that will help minimize your symptoms
  * Show you how to take your medication properly, checking your inhaler technique
  * Work with you so you have a written [Asthma Action Plan](https://asthma.ca/get-help/living-with-asthma/asthma-action-plan/)
  * Recommend that you visit on a regular basis so that your symptoms can be monitored and your treatments adjusted if necessary



## Prescribing medication

In order to minimize possible side effects, your healthcare provider will prescribe the lowest dose of medication needed to control your symptoms. It may take some experimenting to find out what that dose is. You and your healthcare team might have to try a few different doses or a few different medications before you find what works best for you. Over time, your medication needs may change.

The asthma medications that are prescribed may differ from patient to patient. It is important that you understand how to take your medications and why you are taking them. Discuss your symptoms and asthma control with your healthcare team and work together to get the right treatment and dose of medication so that you can lead a normal life, unrestricted by asthma symptoms. These medications are prescribed for you to gain asthma control and to relieve your asthma symptoms. Do not stop taking your medications on your own.

Remember that asthma means having some underlying inflammation in your airways as well as having bronchoconstriction. Because there are two components you may need different medications to treat each component.

Asthma medications are delivered by inhaler devices that deliver the medication straight to the airways. They can also be prescribed as tablets.

It is important that you use your inhaler correctly to ensure that you are getting maximum benefit from your medication. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist to make sure that you are using your inhaler correctly at your next visit.

## Medication Types

Most people with asthma take two kinds of medication. That’s because each asthma medication treats only one aspect of the condition:

  * **Controllers: **treat the persistent inflammation in the airways. Controllers should be taken every day. You will know that the controller medication is working because you will, over time, have fewer and fewer symptoms. When your asthma is totally controlled and you have no symptoms, do not stop taking them, if you do, the airway inflammation may return.
  * **Relievers (Rescue Inhalers) :** are short-acting bronchodilators that provide fast but temporary relief from bronchospasm (tightening of the air ways). Relievers are only a short-term solution to your breathing problem as they treat the acute symptoms but do not treat the underlying airway inflammation. You should always carry your reliever with you at all times. Note how often you are relying on your rescue inhaler — if you need to take it more than **twice** per week (excluding before exercise), your asthma is not well controlled and you should speak with your doctor.

[ Asthma Canada President & CEO Jeffrey Beach and As ![Asthma Canada President & CEO Jeffrey Beach and Asthma Canada Advocate Kimberly Couvillon recently met with Andrew Dowie, MPP for Windsor–Tecumseh, at his constituency office in Windsor.  Kimberly, a resident of Windsor, bravely shared the story of her daughter Amber, who tragically lost her life to an asthma attack at just 14 years old in June 2024.  We’re grateful to MPP Dowie for taking the time to hear Amber’s story and engage in a meaningful discussion about the urgent policy solutions Asthma Canada is proposing. These include ensuring children and adults living with asthma have access to timely, appropriate care and that Certified Respiratory Educators are included in the investments that the Government is making in primary care across the province.  #asthma #windsor andrewdowie](./Medicines & Treatment - Asthma Canada_files/511646652_18280016041257758_969817840527825566_nthumb.webp) ](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLUnENJNznY/)

[ Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  ![Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \(CRSwNP\) and asthma frequently coexist and share similar inflammatory pathways. Having both conditions can lead to more severe symptoms, poorer quality of life, and increased difficulty in managing both conditions.  Oral Corticosteroids \(OCS\) are a common and effective medical treatment option for patients with CRSwNP, often used for short-term control of symptoms. Despite their proven short-term efficacy, OCS are also associated with increased risk of short-and long-term adverse effects, with guidelines in respiratory disease recommending limiting use when possible.  A recent study by @gsk and Asthma Canada found that that 81% of CRSwNP patients were prescribed OCS at least once in the 24 months prior to starting a biologic treatment with 39% of patients being overexposed to OCS by the time they started a biologic. These findings highlight the need for heightened awareness and education to prevent OCS overexposure and enhance patient care.  A huge thanks to Asthma Canada Patient Advocate, Renay Michele Lambert for sharing her story with Pauline Chan and the CTV News team.  #asthma #crswnp #nasalpolyps](./Medicines & Treatment - Asthma Canada_files/510896392_18279924553257758_3493554213857030230_nlow.webp) ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLSN69DOkVE/)
