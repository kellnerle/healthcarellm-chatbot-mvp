# Asthma â€” MSD Manual Professional Edition

---

## Overview

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, leading to episodic airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. It's often reversible and influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

---

## Pathophysiology

- Inflammation of bronchial walls
- Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
- Mucous hypersecretion

---

## Signs and Symptoms

- Recurrent wheezing
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Cough (especially at night or early morning)

---

## Diagnosis

- **Spirometry**: Confirms airflow obstruction and reversibility
- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF)**
- **Methacholine challenge**
- **Allergy testing**

---

## Treatment

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: First-line maintenance therapy
- **Bronchodilators**: SABA for acute relief, LABA for maintenance
- **Biologic agents**: For severe, refractory asthma
- **Avoidance of known triggers**

---

## Prognosis

With proper treatment, most patients have excellent control. Poorly controlled asthma may lead to airway remodeling and chronic complications.
