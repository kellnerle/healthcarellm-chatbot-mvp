## What is an Asthma Attack?

An asthma attack occurs when the muscles around the airways tighten (bronchospasm), and the lining becomes inflamed and swollen, reducing airflow. Mucus production may increase, further restricting breathing.

## Common Symptoms

- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Wheezing (especially when exhaling)
- Coughing, especially at night or early morning
- Trouble sleeping caused by breathing difficulties
- Fatigue or difficulty concentrating
- Symptoms that worsen with exercise or exposure to allergens/triggers

---

## Causes and Triggers

Asthma symptoms may be triggered or worsened by:

- Allergens (pollen, mold, dust mites, pet dander)
- Respiratory infections
- Cold air or weather changes
- Smoke or air pollutants
- Physical activity (exercise-induced asthma)
- Stress or strong emotions
- Certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, NSAIDs)
