How to Use Your Metered-Dose
Inhaler (MDI) With a Spacer
Device
• A metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is filled with
medication that is under pressure. When
you press the top of the MDI, it pushes out
medication for you to inhale (breathe in).
• Always use your MDI with a spacer device
attachment. This device holds the medication
in place and makes it easier to breathe in.
• You can buy a spacer device at most
drugstores without a prescription. Some
insurance plans cover the cost. If you can,
compare the prices of spacers at different
stores before buying.
• This pamphlet explains how to use and take
care of your MDI and spacer device.

Note: Your spacer device may have a whistle to
tell you that you are breathing in too fast. If you
are using the device properly, you should NOT

gets cold, warm it using only your hands.
Do not use anything other than your hands to
warm it.
• Do not puncture (make a hole in) or break the
canister.

them how you are using it.
› If you are having trouble using your MDI,
ask your health care provider for tips, or to
suggest another device.
If you think your MDI is empty:
• Do not float the canister in water.
• Shake it. If it feels light, or if you do not feel
liquid moving, it is empty.
• If your MDI has a counter, 0 (zero) means it is
empty.
