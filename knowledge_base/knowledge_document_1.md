GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE VISIT
WITH YOUR HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER
Successful management of your asthma will involve a team
approach. It is important to work with your health-care
providers and tell them how things are going.
1 B efore your next appointment make sure that you write
down your concerns or questions.
2 At your appointment discuss the following areas:
• W hat is your level of physical activity? Is it less than you
would like because of asthma symptoms?
• How frequently are you using your reliever inhaler? Is this
your usual pattern or are you generally using more or less
medication?
• How frequently are you experiencing asthma symptoms?
• Do you wake up at night because of asthma symptoms?
• What are your asthma triggers?
3 Take notes of what was said for future reference.
4 B ring your asthma medications to your appointment and
ask to have your inhaler technique checked.
5 Ask if you don’t understand something that was said. It is
important to repeat what you think was said and what you
are supposed to do.
If you have any questions call The Lung Association
Lung Health Information Line at 1-888-344-LUNG (5864),
