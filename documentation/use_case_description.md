# Use Case Description: Asthma Medication Reminder and Emergency Guidance Chatbot

---

## Background

In Halifax, Nova Scotia, asthma is a widespread chronic respiratory condition. Patients frequently forget to take daily controller medications or misuse rescue inhalers, which can result in poorly managed symptoms or preventable emergency room visits. While local health authorities like **Nova Scotia Health** and national organizations like the **Canadian Lung Association** offer excellent resources, they are scattered across websites and pamphlets, making them hard to access at the moment theyâ€™re needed.

## Target User

The target users are individuals in Nova Scotia managing asthma, particularly those who:

- Require daily medication reminders  
- May be unsure of how to respond to worsening symptoms  
- Want guidance based on local health standards  
- Seek privacy-preserving, always-available information  

---

## User Pain Points

- Forgetting to take maintenance (controller) inhalers  
- Not recognizing early warning signs of an asthma attack  
- Misusing reliever (rescue) inhalers  
- Lacking access to clear, local asthma action plans in urgent situations  

---

## Success Criteria

The chatbot will be considered successful if it:

- Provides accurate, locally relevant answers to common asthma management questions  
- Reinforces daily controller medication adherence  
- Clearly communicates emergency steps aligned with **Asthma Canada** and **Nova Scotia Health** protocols  
- Contains appropriate disclaimers (e.g., not medical advice)  
- Functions fully offline via the **Ollama** and **AnythingLLM** stack  

---

## Ethical Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of health guidance, the chatbot includes:

- A prominent disclaimer: Not a substitute for professional diagnosis or treatment  
- No data collection, retention, or tracking of users  
- Clear crisis escalation advice (e.g., call 911, seek immediate medical attention)
